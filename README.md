# zsh

Symlink `.zshrc` in your home directory to the one in this repo and everything should be loaded automatically.

[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) is supported out of the box so if you run `git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv` and restart `zsh` you should be good to go.
